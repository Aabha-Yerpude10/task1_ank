           <p style="text-align: center;font-size: smaller; color: aliceblue;">From a young age, Itachi was calm and insightful, showing noticeable maturity for his age and knowledge on how to deal with every situation. For all his accomplishments, talent, and fame, Itachi was a rather humble man. Never arrogant about his own abilities nor underestimating others, most things he said would be unbiased and accurate. If an opponent exceeded his expectations or posed a legitimate challenge to him or his allies, Itachi would freely admit it.As a seven-year-old, his reasoning was on par with a Hokage. Having studied history, not just of his clan or his village but of the world, he gained a broader appreciation of what was important. Learning so much enabled him to understand how events of the past came to happen and, when he applied that same understanding into the future, he became concerned for where things were going.At the same time, Itachi was still fairly na√Øve as a child in many real-world scenarios and as such was willing to learn from his peers on how to differentiate situations.He lived at a distance, observing individuals and ideas without getting directly involved so that he could fully understand them.</p>
